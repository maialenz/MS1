## UX
---

### **User stories**

- As a visiting user I want to: 
    
    - Find out what the company is about.
    - Easily visualize and understand what services the company offers.
    - Be able to use and book one or more services the company has to offer.
    - Be able to use the contact form for the business and service enquiries.
    - Have the option to personalize the services offered.
    - Feel that the company cares and I can trust them caring for my loved dog by seeing other peoples reviews.
    - Be able to know more about the owner by having the option to personally meet them.
    - Know the location of the business and know where those services are offered.
    - Get in touch with the business easily by having contact details clearly available.
    - Be able to book a service quickly by having a direct tab to the contact form.
    - Find social links to be able to follow the business in social media platforms.


### **Business goals**

- The main goal of this business is to provide a dog sitting and walking service to users that are not able or need help to do keep their pets happy and healthy. 
It also wants to help people in need of help with their dogs because they have fallen sick or due to new working-from-home arrangements. 

- The business wants to offer services to make sure that all dogs are given very loving care and treatment as if they were in their own home,
while the owner is away/unavailable.

- Ideally all users that choose a service they would become regular users of one or more services provided by the business, since this is 
an essential need for any person/family that own a pet. If a person/family is happy with the service provided they will choose to book a service
for a longer period of time and more often, making the business very trusted and the go-to one in the local area.

- A long term goal of the business is to create a well-known pet sitting company in the local area so it can have the option to expand to offer
more tailored services withing the local and the surrounding areas with posibility of expantion to nationwide pet sitting company.


## USER CENTERED DESIGN


### **Strategy Plane**

- #### User needs

The needs of the user is to find a person to look after their family dog the same way they would during a short period or longer period of time
because they are not able to do so. 

As the recent pandemic has forced many of us confined to our homes when it comes to work, sickness, etc, many of us have found ourselves having less
time than before when it comes to give the attention that our loved dogs need. This has created a need to find someone to help us giving our dogs some
normality and extra exercice on these times that are also stressful for our pets. Some dogs have become extra sensitive and emotional, or extra hyper with
extra need for longer walks.  

- #### Technical capabilities

    - To use this site the user needs to have access to some internet connection within their chosen device.

    - They also need to have basic knowledge of how to search within a browser and very basic understanding on how to select and navigate 
    the page.

    - This page can be done with Bootstrap framework to create a structure and implement sections that the user needs. The website's
    information will be kept separated in 3 different pages but easy to find and accessible so the user doesn't need to click more than 3 times to
    get to the page they need. It was not posible to add a live time booking on this project due to lack of skills, but would be implemented on a future
    release once the creator of the site gained more skills and knowledge.

- #### Business Vision

The purpose of this project is to create a business to give a personal service to all dog owners that need help walking or dog sitting (within their own homes
or the business owner's home) for a shor or long period of time, ensuring that the dog is loved and cared the same way as their owners would do. The business
also intend to give extra help to those people who has fallen ill with Covid and are struggling to look after their loved dog.

### **Scope plane | Trade-offs**

- **Features within the design plan with highest priority:**

    - Responsive navigation bar.

    - Navigation bar situated on the top of the page with buttons aligned in the middle to see the pages clearly and as expected by the user.

    - Following [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) grid system with the layout of the site
    being mainly in thirds.

    - Footer containing business information and links to social media platforms.

    - A form page that contains radio buttons, required fields and text inputs.

- **Lower priority features that may not be including in the initial release of the website:**

    - Landing page with shortcuts to different pages within the website. 

    - Map showing the exact location of the business.

    - A gallery of pictures showing dogs on the location of the business.

    - Navigation bar changing to a burger icon on smaller screen sizes.

---

### Structure Plane

- The structure of the site will be layed out in three pages to separate the different information and make easier for the user to go
directly to the page they need without needing to scroll down too much to look for the information they are looking for. 

- The layout will be organised in half or thirds depending on the page and the need to separate the information so it's shown on a tidy manner
not to visually overload the user and allow them to see the information on one look.

- The landing page will be used as a shortcut to pages needed by returning users and frequent users to allow them to have a good user experience.

- In order to direct the user to the most important areas of the website, a navbar will be created on the top of the page to be easily located,
including links to other section of the website.

- To ensure the users experience when completing the form for ordering is smooth, this page will contain
minimal information and imagery to not distract the user.

- The footer will contain all the inportant information to contact the business's owners in other ways than filling the form. This will contain
links to the different social media and "address" of the business.

## DESIGN


### **Colors**

The colors used in this project reflect the sea and the beach. Colors found at the location of the business, as this is located
on the seaside of Ireland. I will be using very light colors not to distract the user from the information and to make sure 
there is a right contrast between the colors used in the background and the typography color.

The colors chosen are combinations of: pale blue, light beige/brown, white and shades of grey. The color scheme was created using
[Coolors](https://coolors.co/)

---

### **Typography**

The fonts used for the site were taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). To make sure the information is not distracting and
difficult to read, it was decided to use simple but  and consistent fonts previously used and seen in other projects within Code Institute like:

- "Roboto" 
- "Quicksand"
- "Montserrat"/"Montserrat alternates" (for extra elegance and fun but used minimally not to break the flow of the information)

---

### **Imagery**

- The imagery will be very important on the site, as it's a way to create warmth and familiarity for the dog owners that use the site.

- The landing page and headers on all the pages will be the same hero image to create consistency and bring a seaside feeling to the user. The navbar
will be placed under the logo and above the hero image and will have three linkes to the respective pages. The reason for this is to be visually easy to find and to immediately direct the user to their selected part of the website.

- The imagery used in the website will be minimal and small in order to still keep the balance between aesthetic style and information consistent.

---

### **Logo**

- The logo for site was created using a combination of an online application called [Canva](https://www.canva.com/) and Paint. It has a a little paw logo with a background representing a very light blue sea
provided by the website itself as part of the creation of the logo and it's a nod to the name of the business itself (WET Paws). It was designed in a simple way to represent the reason to be of the business (dog paw) and the name
of the business (Wet Paws).

### Features left to implement

- Gallery: due to the lack of pictures of different dogs and the shot time frame for the project to be done,
I decided to leave the Gallery feature out for the time being. The gallery would be incorporated
once I had a wider customer directory and longer period to implement this feature. 

- Booking calendar: I decided to leave the calendar for booking preference out because I do not have the skills
required to implement this feature.

- Live chat: in a future I would like to add a section to be able to chat directly with the sitter/owner to ask
questions instead of filling a form every time. I leave this feature out due to lack of current skills.

## DEPLOYMENT

### GitHub Pages

This project was built using the [GitPod](https://www.gitpod.io) environment, specifically in the cloud cloud.
    1. To start using the new environment, first a new repository was created in GitHub called [WetPaws](https://github.com/maialenz/WetPaws)
    2. All the commits and pushes made during the building process were made very often to keep the project save and updated.

The project was deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) using the following steps:
1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/join/get-started) and locate the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/maialenz/WetPaws)
    - You can also find it by seaching maialenz/WetPaws on the [GitHub](https://github.com/) seach-bar.

2. Below the repository title at the top, find the "Settings" button on the horizontal or dropdown (small screens) menu

![screenshot of the repository outlining the settings button in yellow](docs/deployment/githubsettings.png)

3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" section.

4. Under the "Source" title, click on the dropdown button called "None" and change the source to "Master Branch".
![screenshot of the dropdown menu showing the "Main Branc" and "None"](docs/deployment/githubpagesbranch.png)

5. The page will automatically refresh

6. When the loading is finished, scroll back down to the GitHub pages section where you will find the deployed [link](https://maialenz.github.io/WetPaws/) to the website.

### Forking the GitHub repository

It is posible to copy and edit this project by any user without changing the repository on the original GitHub account. This can be done by forking the repository by following the following steps (Forking will only make
a copy of the original project, so any changes won't affect the original):

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/join/get-started) and locate the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/maialenz/WetPaws)
    - You can also find it by seaching maialenz/WetPaws on the [GitHub](https://github.com/) seach-bar.

2. Below the repository title at the top, above the "Settings" button on the horizontal menu and under the user's profile logo, locate the "Fork" button and click on it.
![screenshot of the fork button](docs/deployment/forkbutton.png)

3. You will have made a copy of the whole repository in your own GitHub account.

4. To share the changes/edits you have made to improve the original project with the owner, you can submit a pull request.
Find the details to do so following this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/join/get-started) and locate the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/maialenz/WetPaws)
    - You can also find it by seaching maialenz/WetPaws on the [GitHub](https://github.com/) seach-bar.

2. Above the repository files and to the left of the green "GitPod" button, locate the "Code" or "download" button and click on it.
![screenshot of cloning code button](docs/deployment/clonecode.png)

3. To clone the repository using HTTPS copy the link on display (you can click on the clipboard to copy it faster).
![screenshot of the HTTPS clone link](docs/deployment/clonehttps.png)

4. If you are working on a desktop application, follow the documentation found on number 9. For cloud based, open your own terminal in GitPod.

5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.

6. In the terminal type ````git clone```` and then paste the URL copied on step 3

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
```

7.Press Enter. This will create your local clone.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

8. To open a preview port within your own local workspace type:

```
$ python3 -m http.server
```

9. If you use GitHub desktop follow the steps documented [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop).
